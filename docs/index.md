## ESP32 with Tensorflow Lite and Teachable Machine

This repository is to help you to use ESP32 as the deployment platform for Tensorflow Lite.

We will use the doorbell example together with an AI Thinker ESP32-CAM board as the target.

First you will need to follow the instructions on https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/08/announcing-tensorflow-lite-micro-esp32.html in order to setup your environment as well as compile ad build the sample doorbell example.

Once that is done, we can use Teachable machine https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ to train a custom model and modify the example code to use our custom model.
